Connect Elementor Pro's Loop Grid to Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) Pro Repeater and Relationship fields.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to use ACF Repeater and ACF Relationship fields as data sources for Elementor's Loop Grid widget.

**Key Features:**

*   **New Data Sources:** Adds "ACF Repeater" and "ACF Relationship" to the Source dropdown in the Loop Grid's Query tab.
*   **Use Repeater Data:** Select any ACF Repeater field from the current post/page to power your Loop Grid.
*   **Use Relationship Data:** Select any ACF Relationship field to create a grid of related posts in your Loop Grid.
*   **Repeater Sub-Field Tag:** A dedicated dynamic tag to easily pull and display data (text, images, etc.) from any sub-field within your repeater.
*   **Relationship Sub-Field Tag:** A dynamic tag to display data from the related posts, such as the post title, content, featured image, and permalink.

== Requirements ==

*   **Elementor**
*   **Elementor Pro**
*   **Advanced Custom Fields Pro** (The Repeater and Relationship fields are ACF Pro features)

== Installation ==

1.  Ensure you have all the required plugins (Elementor, Elementor Pro, ACF Pro) installed and activated.
2.  Upload the plugin ZIP file through the Plugins screen, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3.  Activate the plugin through the Plugins screen in WordPress.

== Usage ==

**1. Configure the Loop Grid**

1.  Add an Elementor Loop Grid widget to your page.
2.  In the widget settings, go to the **Query** tab.
3.  From the **Source** dropdown, select "ACF Repeater" or "ACF Relationship".
4.  A new dropdown will appear below the Source. Select the specific ACF field you wish to use as the data source for the grid.
5.  Create or select a template for your loop item.

**2. Displaying Data in Your Loop Template (ACF Repeater)**

1.  Edit the Elementor template you are using for your loop item.
2.  Add any standard widget, such as a Heading, Text Editor, or Image widget.
3.  Click the **Dynamic Tags** icon next to a field.
4.  Scroll to the "ACF Connector" group and select the **ACF Repeater Sub Field** tag.
5.  Click on the tag name again to open its settings.
6.  In the **Sub Field** dropdown, select the specific sub-field you want to display. The fields are grouped by repeater name for clarity.

Note that the preview within the template will not display the sub-field data. This is expected behavior because no applicable preview data can be set in Elementor.

**3. Displaying Data in Your Loop Template (ACF Relationship)**

1.  Edit the Elementor template you are using for your loop item.
2.  Your template will be supplied with a standard WordPress Post object, so just create your template as you normally would.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What are the plugin requirements?**
You must have Elementor, Elementor Pro, and Advanced Custom Fields Pro installed and activated. The Repeater and Relationship fields are both ACF Pro features.

**Can I get data from a repeater on a site-wide options page?**
Yes! When you select "ACF Repeater" or "ACF Relationship" as your source, a "Data Source" dropdown appears. It lists "Current Post/Page" (the default) along with any registered ACF Options Pages. Select the options page that contains your field, then choose the field name as usual.

**Why isn't my ACF field showing up in the dropdown?**
The dropdowns in the Loop Grid query settings only show fields that are available on the specific post or page you are currently editing with Elementor. Ensure that the post has a value saved for the ACF field you are trying to select.
